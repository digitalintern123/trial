database.py — SQLite persistence layer for the Revenue Analytics platform.

Design notes:
- The database is the single source of truth for all revenue data.
- st.session_state should only ever hold lightweight references (selected
  dates, UI state) — never DataFrames of revenue data. This module is what
  every page calls to actually fetch data, so navigating between pages never
  loses anything.
- A UNIQUE constraint on (date, segment, outlet, location) makes re-uploading
  the same day's report a safe no-op: duplicate rows are skipped, not errored.

    inclusive, grouped by location (and terminal, kept separate) — this is
    the function that actually handles daily vs monthly granularity
    correctly, which a naive per-row join cannot do.

    Strategy per location:
      1. If daily rows fully cover every date in the range, sum the daily
         rows — this is the most accurate option.
      2. Otherwise, fall back to monthly rows whose [date, period_end]
         span overlaps the requested range. A monthly row is prorated by
         the fraction of its days that fall inside the requested range
         (e.g. requesting just the first half of a month against a
         monthly total prorates that total roughly in half) — this is an
         approximation flagged via the `is_estimated` column, since a
         monthly total has no real daily shape to draw from.
      3. If both exist for an overlapping period, daily takes precedence
         for the days it actually covers, and monthly only fills the
         remaining gap days that its own period actually spans.
      4. Any requested date with neither a daily row nor a monthly row
         covering it (a genuine data gap, e.g. a month nobody uploaded
         traffic for at all) is counted in `missing_days` and excluded
         from the total rather than silently treated as zero or silently
         papered over by an unrelated month's monthly figure.

    Returns columns: location, terminal, traffic, is_estimated (bool, True
    if any part of that location+terminal's total came from a prorated
    monthly figure rather than real daily data), missing_days (int, count
    of requested dates with no data at all — callers should warn the user

    """
    Aggregate a revenue DataFrame (potentially many outlet/date rows) down
    to one row per location — Revenue and PAX summed across every
    outlet/date in `revenue_df` — with a single, range-correct Traffic
    total attached for that location (see get_traffic_total_for_range).

    IMPORTANT — this deliberately returns one row per location, NOT one
    row per original revenue_df row. Traffic is airport-wide, not
    outlet- or day-specific, so there is exactly one correct Traffic
    figure per location for the whole date range revenue_df spans.
    Earlier this function stamped that same range-total onto every
    outlet/date row instead, on the assumption a caller would dedupe it
    back down before summing (as revenue_analysis.
    location_level_summary_with_traffic does for genuine per-date traffic
    data) — but a dedupe keyed on (date, location) keeps one row per
    distinct *date*, not per location, so it still summed the same
    range-total once per day in the range, multiplying Traffic (and
    therefore silently shrinking Penetration % and SPP) by however many
    days the comparison period covered. Returning exactly one row per
    location makes that miscount impossible.

    Uses get_traffic_total_for_range() internally, so daily vs monthly
    granularity is handled correctly (see that function's docstring) — if
    `traffic_df` is explicitly given instead (e.g. by a caller that
    already loaded a specific slice), it's used as-is via a simple sum,
    skipping the daily/monthly reconciliation logic, so prefer leaving
    `traffic_df` as None unless you know what you're passing.

    Returns columns: location, date (a representative date, kept only so
    this shape matches what revenue_analysis.
    location_level_summary_with_traffic expects), revenue, pax, traffic,
    traffic_is_estimated, traffic_missing_days. Rows whose location has
    no matching traffic at all get NaN traffic, not 0 — this matters for
    has_traffic_data() and the penetration/SPP calculations downstream,
    which need to distinguish "no traffic data yet" from "traffic was
    genuinely zero that day".

    exactly the dates revenue_df contains) alongside its AOP target,
    prorated to a daily rate within the month and multiplied by however
    many days of that month are actually present in `revenue_df`, so a
    partial-month revenue range (e.g. just the first 10 days) is compared
    against a proportional slice of that month's AOP target rather than
    the whole month's target.

    IMPORTANT — this deliberately returns one row per outlet-month, NOT
    one row per original revenue_df row. Earlier this function left-
    joined the (already-prorated) target onto every individual date-row
    for that outlet, on the assumption a caller would pull a single value
    per outlet-month back out. But callers (e.g. revenue_analysis.
    aop_variance) instead sum the returned column directly — and summing
    the *same* prorated total once per date-row silently multiplied every
    outlet's AOP target by however many days of that month were present
    in revenue_df. Returning exactly one row per outlet-month makes that
    miscount impossible: summing `revenue` or `aop_target` across the
    rows this function returns always yields the correct total, with
    nothing left to double-count.

    Returns columns: location, outlet, revenue (actual, summed over the
    dates present), aop_target. Rows with no matching AOP target (a new
    outlet, an out-of-scope location, or a period with no AOP data
    loaded) get NaN aop_target, not 0 — same "missing vs genuinely zero"
    distinction used throughout this module.

    This is independent of any pre-existing `aop` column already on
    individual revenue_master rows from a historical Excel import — that
    legacy per-row AOP figure lives on `revenue_df` itself and is not
