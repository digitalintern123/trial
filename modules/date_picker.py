"""
date_picker.py — A more convenient date-selection widget: separate
Year / Month / Day dropdowns instead of one long flat list of every
available date.

A single flat dropdown gets unwieldy fast once the database spans
multiple years (e.g. a multi-year historical import, or AOP-adjacent
revenue history) — scrolling through hundreds of individual dates to
find the one you want is exactly the "headache" this replaces.

Only years/months/days that actually have data in `available_dates` are
ever offered at each step: picking a year narrows the month dropdown to
months with data in that year, and picking a month narrows the day
dropdown to days with data in that year+month — so changing Year resets
Month, and changing Month resets Day, so you always land on a valid date.

    Render three chained dropdowns (Year → Month → Day) and return the
    selected date. Returns None if `available_dates` is empty.

    Chaining means:
    - Month list is filtered to the currently selected Year.
    - Day list is filtered to the currently selected Year + Month.
    - When Year changes, Month resets to the latest available month in
      that year (and Day resets accordingly).
    - When Month changes, Day resets to the latest available day in
      that year+month.

    This prevents the stale-index bug where Streamlit keeps an old month
    or day index in session_state after the parent dropdown changes.
